## Abstract

This LIP defines the official, standardized binary layout interpreted by the Genesis LEA Transaction Decoder.  
As the first canonical decoder in the LEA model, it is based on the Simple Compact Transaction Protocol (SCTP) primitives introduced in [LIP-6](LIP-6.md). The format follows a flexible, invocation-based structure, including a unified address vector, gas configuration, a sequence of invocation instructions, and a dual-signature scheme (Ed25519 and Falcon-512).

## Motivation

While [LIP-6](LIP-6.md) defines the low-level data primitives for encoding data, it does not define the high-level structure of a transaction (the "grammar"). A standard transaction format is essential for all network participants to interpret, validate, and process transactions in a uniform way. This proposal provides that standard, detailing the exact order, type, and meaning of each component within a transaction. It also specifies the precise method for hashing and signing transactions to ensure cryptographic integrity.

## Specification

All LEA transactions MUST be serialized according to the following structure, using the SCTP encoding types defined in [LIP-6](LIP-6.md). The transaction's total decoded size MUST NOT exceed 1MB.

### Core Type System

The transaction format utilizes a specific subset of the SCTP types:

| SCTP Type ID | Name      | Description                                 |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `8`          | `ULEB128` | Unsigned variable-length integer            |
| `13`         | `VECTOR`  | Raw byte array with a length prefix         |
| `15`         | `EOF`     | End-of-transaction marker (literal byte: `0x0F`) |

---

### LEA Transaction Format (as interpreted by Genesis Decoder)

A transaction is a sequence of core fields followed by a variable number of `Invocation` blocks and `SignaturePair` blocks.

| Field         | Type              | Description                                       |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`     | `ULEB128`         | Transaction format version. The value MUST be `1`. |
| `sequence`    | `ULEB128`         | Sender's nonce or sequence number                 |
| `addresses`   | `VECTOR`          | 32-byte addresses; signers first, fee payer first |
| `gasLimit`    | `ULEB128`         | Max gas units allowed                             |
| `gasPrice`    | `ULEB128`         | Price per gas unit                                |
| `invocations` | `Invocation[]`    | One or more invocation instructions               |
| `signatures`  | `SignaturePair[]` | One signature pair per signer                     |
| `EOF`         | Byte (`0x0F`)     | End-of-transaction marker (literal byte)          |

---

### Invocation Block

| Field          | Type      | Description                                          |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `targetIndex`  | `ULEB128` | Index into the `addresses` vector (0-based)          |
| `instructions` | `VECTOR`  | Instruction bytecode intended for the target address |

---

### SignaturePair Block

| Field                  | Type                   | Description                             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `ed25519Signature`     | `VECTOR` (64 bytes)    | Ed25519 signature over the hash         |
| `falcon512Signature` | `VECTOR` (variable) | Falcon-512 signature for PQC security |

---

### Notation Key

* `[]` = Repeating block (zero or more)
* `VECTOR` = Length-prefixed byte array
* All field names are case-sensitive and must follow the specified order

---

### Field Constraints and Rules

1.  **Addresses (`addresses`):**
    *   This field is a single SCTP `VECTOR` containing all 32-byte addresses involved in the transaction.
    *   The `addresses` vector MUST be assembled using a deterministic, three-tiered sorting algorithm to ensure a single, canonical representation:
        a.  **Group 1 (Fee Payer):** The address of the fee payer MUST be the **first** address in the vector (index 0).
        b.  **Group 2 (Other Signers):** The addresses of all other signers (i.e., the signers from index 1 to N-1) MUST be sorted amongst themselves based on their 32-byte binary lexicographical value. These are appended to the vector immediately after the fee payer.
        c.  **Group 3 (Non-Signer Addresses):** All remaining unique, non-signer addresses MUST also be sorted amongst themselves based on their 32-byte binary lexicographical value. These are appended last.
    *   The `addresses` vector MUST NOT contain duplicate entries.
    *   The total byte length of the vector MUST be a multiple of 32.

2.  **Invocations:**
    *   The transaction contains one or more `Invocation` blocks.
    *   Each `Invocation` consists of a `targetIndex` (`ULEB128`) followed by an `instructions` field (`VECTOR`).
    *   The `targetIndex` MUST be a valid, 0-based index into the `addresses` vector.
    *   The `instructions` field contains the application-specific instruction bytecode to be executed in the context of the targeted address.

3.  **Signature Set:**
    *   The number of `SignaturePair` blocks implicitly defines the number of signed addresses. If there are `N` signature pairs, then the first `N` addresses in the `addresses` vector are considered signers.
    *   Each `SignaturePair` corresponds one-to-one with the signers in the `addresses` vector by index.
    *   Each `SignaturePair` contains two `VECTOR`s:
        *   `ed25519Signature`: A 64-byte Ed25519 signature.
        *   `falcon512Signature`: A variable-length Falcon-512 signature.

4.  **Termination:**
    *   Every valid transaction MUST end with a single EOF byte (`0x0F`).
    *   No other data is permitted after the EOF marker.

---

### Hashing and Signing Protocol

*   **Hashing:** The transaction hash is the `BLAKE3` digest of the byte stream from the `version` field up to and including the final byte of the last `Invocation` block's `instructions` field. The `SignatureSet` and the final EOF marker are **excluded** from the hash.
*   **Signing:** For every signing address, a corresponding `SignaturePair` must be provided. The Ed25519 and Falcon-512 signatures are calculated over the transaction hash.  
    Signature verification MUST be performed in index order, matching each `SignaturePair` to the corresponding address in the `addresses` vector, starting from index `0`.

---

## Rationale

*   **Flexible Invocations:** The repeating block structure for invocations allows for complex transactions that can interact with multiple programs in a single atomic unit.
*   **Implicit Signer Count:** Deriving the number of signers from the number of `SignaturePair` blocks simplifies parsing and removes the need for a separate field to declare the signer count.
*   **Unified Address List:** A single `addresses` vector simplifies address management and indexing for invocations.
*   **Dual Signatures:** Requiring both Ed25519 and Falcon-512 (a PQC algorithm) signatures provides both high performance for standard validation and long-term security against quantum attacks.
*   **SCTP Base:** Building on [LIP-6](LIP-6.md), this ensures that the low-level encoding is consistent with the rest of the protocol.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LIP defines a new, foundational application-layer standard. It does not replace a previously defined transaction format LIP. As such, it does not introduce a backwards compatibility break in the LIP process, but its adoption is a mandatory and breaking change for any client or node software wishing to interact with the LEA network, in conjunction with the adoption of LIP-6.

---

## Security Considerations

*   **Hashing Integrity:** Validators MUST strictly adhere to the specified hashing protocol. Including any part of the `SignatureSet` in the hash would invalidate all signatures.
*   **Signature Verification:** For each `SignaturePair`, both the Ed25519 and Falcon-512 signatures must be successfully verified against the transaction hash using the public key of the corresponding signing address. A failure in either verification invalidates the transaction.
*   **Index-out-of-Bounds:** Parsers MUST validate that each `targetIndex` in an invocation is a valid index within the `addresses` vector. An invalid index must cause the transaction to be rejected.
*   **Vector Length Validation:** Parsers MUST validate that the `addresses` vector length is a multiple of 32 and that the `ed25519Signature` vector has the correct fixed length of 64 bytes. Failure to do so could lead to buffer overflows or incorrect data interpretation.
*   **Fee Payer:** For signed transactions, the first entry in the `addresses` vector is the fee payer. Logic for deducting fees must correctly and exclusively identify this address. Unsigned transactions do not have a designated fee payer.
